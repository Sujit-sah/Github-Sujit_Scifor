2. What is css box modele?

CSS Box Model:

The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that defines how the element's
dimensions and spacing are calculated.
The box model treats every HTML element as a rectangular box consisting of
content, padding, border, and margin.
The box model defines the layout of an HTML element in the following way:

The components of the box model are:
• content: actual text or image that is displayed in the element
• padding: transparent space between the content and the border of an
element
• border: line that surrounds the padding and content within the element
• margin: transparent area added outside the border
The primary purpose of the box model is to explain how the dimensions and
spacing of elements are calculated and how they relate to each other.
